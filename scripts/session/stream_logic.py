"""
The logic a stream of node addresses needs, per code: what the receiver must decide at each item, what one
flipped bit does, and what happens when the tree outgrows what was agreed in advance. For
.docs/p4/nested-store.md, section 5.

Streams: random sequences of Zeckendorf store addresses (p4 = 1, .claude = 0; start and end with 1, no 11) of
up to MAXLEN digits, the addresses run Z grows. Codes:
  fibonacci   the address digits least significant first, then 1: the comma is the pair the tree never makes
  gamma       Elias-gamma of the address's integer value (universal: no width agreed either)
  fixed       the value in W bits, W agreed in advance from the largest address then known
  lenfield    a fixed-width length field, then the address digits

Measured:
  decisions   branch decisions per decoded item, counted by instrumented decoders (one per comparison the decoder
              makes to know where it is: a digit test, a mode switch, a counter test)
  flips       every single-bit flip of the stream: whether the decoder can tell (a 11 inside a codeword, a value out
              of range, a stream that does not end cleanly) and how many items decode wrong before it is back in step
  growth      a stream whose addresses grow one digit past what fixed and lenfield agreed on: which codes still parse

Run (2026-10-27):  python scripts/session/stream_logic.py --items 2000 --maxlen 12
