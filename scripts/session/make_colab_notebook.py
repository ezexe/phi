TEACHER_MD = "## 7. The teacher leg: Claude labels the pools\np4 now trains its models on labels from a teacher: roboto, on Anthropic's most capable model, reading in the Haiku children's seat (vlds 0.0.76, `pool-audit-via:`). This section runs that teacher over every labelled pool of the store, through the Claude API, and measures what its labels do.\n- **Picks.** For each pool, `TEACHER_MODEL` (Claude Fable 5.1 by default, the most capable widely released model) sees the task and the same candidate entries the store's own labels were chosen from. It returns the entries that bear on the task, at most 6 a file, the rule the child readers follow. Each pool's answer is saved to Drive as it lands, so a disconnect loses nothing.\n- **Agreement.** How far the teacher's picks match the store's own labels, which came from the operator's review and the Haiku children.\n- **Cross test.** The suite's pretrained one-large-model base, fine-tuned on each label set in turn (4 folds over the pools), scored against both label sets. If training on the teacher's labels predicts the store's labels as well as training on the store's labels does, the teacher teaches at least as well.\n- **Cost.** The input is counted with the API's free token counter before any call, and the run stops before spending if the estimate is above `TEACHER_MAX_USD`. Prices are from the claude-api skill's model table, cached 2026-10-06.\n- **Key.** Read from the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable or a Colab secret of that name. Never printed or saved.\n- **Workspace.** An API key that is not scoped to a workspace must name one on each request: set `TEACHER_WORKSPACE_ID`, or a Colab secret `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`, to a workspace ID from the Claude Console (Settings, Workspaces). A key created inside a workspace needs neither.\n\nSkip this section with `RUN_TEACHER = False`."

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ezexe/phi/blob/main/.docs/p4/q_matrix_colab.ipynb)

This notebook checks what [`.docs/p4/nested-store.md`](https://github.com/ezexe/phi/blob/main/.docs/p4/nested-store.md) claims about the p4 store and its models. Every claim is either proved or measured, and every result lands on your Google Drive.

1. **Exact proofs**, in seconds:
   - The nesting rule (no p4 directly in a p4) is the matrix M = [[1,1],[1,0]].
   - The number of store addresses of each length is a Fibonacci number.
   - Each address is a distinct Zeckendorf integer.
   - Cassini's identity holds.
   - `phi_mask` never keeps two adjacent rows.
   - The address stream needs no length field.
2. **The labelled pairs** of the store, exported by the vlds plugin.
3. **Nested against one model** (`scripts/session/nested_suite.py`):
   - Runs at k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 nodes, on two seeds.
   - Answers the open question: is the k = 4 win a property of the Q matrix's 4 cells, or of shard size?
   - Measures whether the matrix route finds the best node above chance at every k.
   - Measures whether φ routing beats 2:4 routing.
4. **The effort tiers** on the store (`phi_rank.tree`):
   - The tree's held-out score at medium and at high.
   - Whether the JSON ranker keeps the tree's `.pt` weight.
5. **A summary** with the verdicts and a plot, written to Drive.
6. **Optional:** commit the results into ezexe/phi on a branch.

**Disconnects.** Colab can drop the runtime, the local disk and every variable at any time, so:
- Everything is written under `DRIVE_DIR/RUN` on your Drive as it is produced: results, model caches, logs and the pinned commit of every repository.
- Each step records itself as done in `state.json` on Drive.
- After a disconnect, reconnect and choose **Runtime → Run all**:
  - Finished steps are skipped.
  - The suite resumes from its last saved model, fold set or arm.
  - The repositories are re-cloned at the same pinned commits, so the numbers stay comparable across sessions.

**Runtime: choose the T4 GPU** (Runtime → Change runtime type → T4 GPU).
- `phi_rank` trains on a CUDA GPU when it finds one. Section 2 runs a short self-check on it first, and falls back to the CPU, saying so, if the check fails.
- The TPU runtime gives no speedup here: the models are small embedding tables that need `torch_xla` to use a TPU at all. On a TPU runtime the notebook trains on its CPU.
- Each run pretrains for a fixed number of minutes, so faster hardware trains more steps and every arm improves. Compare arms within this notebook's run, not against the figures in the doc, which came from an 8-core CPU.
- Keep one runtime type for the whole plan. The notebook records the device each run used, and warns if a resumed session runs on a different one.
- The full plan (6 node counts × 2 seeds) may span several Colab sessions; the resume makes that safe.

**Secrets.** The store repository is private. Add a GitHub token as a Colab secret named `GITHUB_TOKEN` (🔑 in the left bar), with read access to the store repository, plus write access to ezexe/phi if you set `PUSH_RESULTS`. The token is read from Colab's secrets and never printed or saved.

- M<sup>n</sup> = [[F(n+1), F(n)], [F(n), F(n−1)]], and det M<sup>n</sup> = (−1)<sup>n</sup> (Cassini).
- Store addresses start and end with a p4 and never put a p4 directly in a p4. There are F(n−2) of them of length n ≥ 2.
- With Fibonacci weights, every address up to length 20 is a distinct integer.
- `phi_rank.tree.parent` is defined for every address, so the tree has a single root.
- `phi_mask` never keeps two adjacent rows.

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ezexe/phi/blob/main/.docs/p4/pathways_colab.ipynb)

The p4 store grows as a directory tree: a `p4` holds `.claude` directories, and a `.claude` may hold a `p4`, never a `p4` directly in a `p4`. Read that tree as a network's pathways: one small model per directory node, each trained on its own era of the store's text, a parent built from its children. [`nested-store.md`](https://github.com/ezexe/phi/blob/main/.docs/p4/nested-store.md) measured that tree against one large model. This notebook runs the controls that settle *what the tree adds*: is it the φ structure, or only the splitting into small models?

1. **Trees.** The same nodes, data shards and budget, three ways:
   - **Zeckendorf tree**: nodes at the store's Zeckendorf addresses, the p4 nesting rule.
   - **Binary tree**: the same number of nodes at power-of-2 heap addresses, no adjacency rule.
   - **Flat**: independent nodes, no tree.

   All three are compared against one large model.
2. **Masks as routes.** The Zeckendorf nodes, pruned four ways (φ's adjacency mask, 2:4, a random half of the rows, the heaviest half). Each is used as an ensemble and as a route that sends the task to one node. If the heaviest-rows mask routes as well as φ, the adjacency rule adds nothing to routing.
3. **Early stopping.** Every pretraining checks its ranking on held-back dev pools every `CHECK_S` seconds and keeps its best weights. Each model's curve shows whether longer pretraining helps or hurts; the T4 runs suggested it hurts. The dev pools are kept out of every score.

Everything is saved to Google Drive as it is produced, and **Run all** after a disconnect resumes where Drive says it stopped (see the Q-matrix notebook for how). Secrets: `GITHUB_TOKEN` (read access to the store repository; write access to ezexe/phi only with `PUSH_RESULTS`).

**Runtime:** the T4 GPU if you can get one (the T4 copy is `pathways_colab_t4.ipynb`); the CPU works, slower. Each seed pretrains four model families for `MINUTES` each, then fine-tunes about 120 small models: roughly an hour a seed on a T4.

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ezexe/phi/blob/main/.docs/p4/directions_colab.ipynb)

The runs so far ([`nested-store.md`](https://github.com/ezexe/phi/blob/main/.docs/p4/nested-store.md) and the Colab results under `.docs/p4/nested-store-results/`) point to five directions. This notebook measures each one and ends with a single report:

| | Direction | What this notebook measures |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Keep the JSON ranker as the default | its leave-one-pool-out ranking against plain word overlap, scored against the store's labels and each teacher's |
| D2 | Fix pretraining before more architecture | the single `.pt` ranker at pretraining budgets from 30 s to 6 min, with early stopping on held-back pools: which budget ranks best, and whether any of them raises the JSON ranker |
| D3 | Keep the tree for what it proves | update size, forgetting and query time per arm, from the Q-matrix suite already run |
| D4 | Labels are the main lever | two teachers through the Anthropic API (Claude Fable 5.1 and Claude Opus 5.5) label every pool; models trained on each label set and scored against each; how far the label sets agree |
| D5 | Settle whether the φ structure matters | the pathways notebook's verdicts, read from its run on Drive |

**The Anthropic API** is used wherever it serves the work: the two teachers, and the closing written report, which Claude drafts from the measured JSON, with the numbers printed beside it. The run reuses an earlier run's teacher labels when the pairs match exactly, so nothing is labelled twice.

**Drive.** As the other notebooks: everything is saved to Drive as it is produced, and **Run all** after a disconnect resumes where it stopped. To compare with the Q-matrix run, the store is pinned to the commit that run used, and its pairs file is reused (`FROM_RUN`).

**Secrets:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`, if your key is not scoped to a workspace

**Runtime:** the T4 if you can get it (`directions_colab_t4.ipynb`); the CPU works. D2 pretrains five budgets on two seeds, about 27 minutes of pretraining a seed, then fine-tunes for each label set.
